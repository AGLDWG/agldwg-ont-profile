# Australian Government Ontology Profile
A profile of OWL for the purposes of Australian Government ontology documentation.

This is a *profile*, that is a specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of another specifications. In this case, this profile constrains and extendes the [OWL 2 Web Ontology Language
RDF-Based Semantics](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/) to create a *data shape* for OWL ontologies that requires certain OWL and other ontology properties and patterns to be present. These properties allow certain forms of ontology classification, documentation and evaluation that the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](http://www.linked.data.gov.au) use to organise ontologies produced by Australian government.

This profile is formally described using the [Profiles Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/) and a machine-redable ([RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)) and human-readable (HTML) form of it are available:

* [profile.ttl](profile.ttl) - RDF (turtle serialization)
